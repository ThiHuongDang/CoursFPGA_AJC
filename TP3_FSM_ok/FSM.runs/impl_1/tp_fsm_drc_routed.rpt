2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net uut/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin uut/led_output_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell uut/led_output_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net uut/counter_led_reg[0]_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin uut/FSM_sequential_next_state_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell uut/FSM_sequential_next_state_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port end_counter_cycle expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
